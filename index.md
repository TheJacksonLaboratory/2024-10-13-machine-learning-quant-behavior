Collaborative Notes

If you want to use an Etherpad, go to

https://pad.carpentries.org/YYYY-MM-DD-site

where 'YYYY-MM-DD-site' is the identifier for your workshop,
e.g., '2015-06-10-esu'.

Note we also have a CodiMD (the open-source version of HackMD)
available at https://codimd.carpentries.org

{% comment %}
SCHEDULE

Show the workshop's schedule.

Small changes to the schedule can be made by modifying the
`schedule.html` found in the `_includes` folder for your
workshop type (`swc`, `lc`, or `dc`). Edit the items and
times in the table to match your plans. You may also want to
change 'Day 1' and 'Day 2' to be actual dates or days of the
week.

For larger changes, a blank template for a 4-day workshop
(useful for online teaching for instance) can be found in
`_includes/custom-schedule.html`. Add the times, and what
you will be teaching to this file. You may also want to add
rows to the table if you wish to break down the schedule
further. To use this custom schedule here, replace the block
of code below the Schedule `<h2>` header below with
`{% include custom-schedule.html %}`.
{% endcomment %}

<h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>

{% include none/schedule.html %}


{% comment %}
Edit/replace the text above if you want to include a schedule table.
See the contents of the _includes/custom-schedule.html file for an example of
how one of these schedule tables is constructed.
{% endcomment %}

{% if site.pilot %}
The lesson taught in this workshop is being piloted and a precise schedule is yet to be established. The workshop will include regular breaks. Please [contact the workshop organisers](#contact) if you would like more information about the planned schedule.

SETUP

Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
section is inside a 'div' without any classes to make the beginning
and end easier to find.

This is the other place where people frequently make mistakes, so
please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
'tools/check' as well.
